# Mori Calliope – INSOMNIAC BLACK

```
I'm reaching out
To the me that I used to be
Know it's all about the side that you choose to
free
Let loose and decide on the star you're meant to
see
Searching endlessly
But I still believe
In the middle of the haze and confusion
In a state of mind that pays in illusion
I pretend that I have changed as a human
But I'll wake tomorrow just to fall into a new
sin
Out of luck, out of money, I was out of my mind
Had enough being somebody nobody could find
I left that behind, I put pain aside,
I sought change and payed for going in blind
Lost count of times I lost time and counted
Sleepless nights, still surrounded by lights
Confounded by highways, I took the low roads
Left at my feet, your cold bones and cast stones
Life without heartache
With no reason to sing
Paints a future where no one's waiting
夜空を追いかけて
この場所に来た
めぐりめぐる
運命に逆らって
出会い思いを通わせた
The strangers I followed with stars in my eyes
We owned every sky-burned night
移り変わる
季節と同じだけ
歩むそれぞれの未来へ
Our lives may change tides, but before it all
ends
I'll find you again
I'll find you again
I'm reaching out
To the me that I used to be
Give your all to the side that you choose to
free
Let loose and decide on the view you want to see
Searching aimlessly
But I still believe
Now the city is a maze and mirror
Living like a stray, but I see the world clearer
I'd give it all away for a moment of peace
But there are ghosts in these alleys I could
never release
In these empty streets, there used to echo songs
From a time and place that I once belonged
But what is lost can be found if you can be
strong
Even now, feels like I was never gone
High hopes came at my heart, but so did doubt
A face in the crowd you would edit out
To the dreamer, if you could only see me now
Would you still sing half as loud?
(I gotta know)
Life without heartache
With no reason to sing
Paints a future where no one's waiting
弱さを抱きかかえ
この場所に来た
めぐりめぐる
運命に逆らって
出会い思いを通わせた
The strangers I followed with stars in my eyes
We owned every sky-burned night
移り変わる
季節と同じだけ
歩むそれぞれの未来へ
Our lives may change tides, but before it all
ends
I'll find you again
I'll find you again
