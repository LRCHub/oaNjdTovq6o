Gawvi, get 'em

Hey Mineo, let's go (yeah)
Going in today (day), this my only shot
My life could end today, yeah, my heart stop
If I go out tonight, I'm going out on top
I give it all, this life ain't all I got
Yessir, now wait a minute bro, I see ya rocking' with yo' hands high
Waitin' for that beat to take off, 808s on stand by
When I'm breathing bangers I say statements that I stand by
(Pretty sure I ain't gonna let) that beat drop, landslide

Please let me off my leash (huh)
I feel it, I feel it, I'm feeling too good
Like I'm a beast
Like a gorilla who's railing' the hood

So I'm going on and on
I'll be resting when I'm gone
Rise and grind is what I'm on
Bro that's why I wrote the song

Tonight I'm going off like my life span lasts all night
If I don't wake up in the morning bro, I'm gon' be alright
Throw caution to the wind, leggo, we 'bout to go in
Don't slow me down, we gon' win
Don't slow me down, we know Him. Brag

Tonight I'll out and follow and live like my life's about tomorrow
We love it when we go hard all week
To the top, it ain't no sleep, cuz we gettin' it, gettin' it, gettin' it

Insomnia -ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (We be) gettin' it, gettin' it, gettin' it) Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh... Insomniac x2
Insomnia -ay (gettin' it, gettin' it, gettin' it) x2

Throw caution to the wind, leggo, we 'bout to go in
No slowing down, we gon' win
No slowing down, we know Him
Okay, okay, okay, I get it
What's the point of playing the game if you don't win it?
I ain't never spit a sweet 16, I call that a gift, so you know I gotta bring it

Ya'll live like minutes is infinite
If time isn't money, then why you tripping to spend it
Finally found a girl that ain't in her phone all the time
So you know I had to ring it (bling)

Oh my, Oh God. That ain't common
No girl, that's impressive
I'm trying to fight with the cause
Ya'll wanna fight in my comments section

Dang, I don't get it though
Like deadbeat dads, I don't get involved
They said I'd never be nuthin'
But I think I still turned out awesome

I ain't into talking, I just get it done
They want to get a job, or wanna get a gun (huh)
They wanna get a blunt, and get burnt out like me in the sun. Why?

I, I, ... don't sleep now, that's insomnia
Y'all worry about when your Jordan's drop
But you don't worry about when your body does? Dang
