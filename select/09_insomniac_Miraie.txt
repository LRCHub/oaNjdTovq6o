You a fake bitch please fall back
Dark sky late night on a Cadillac
Close the light, yeah it's pitch black
Don't scare, I'm here insomniac
Feeling lucky I hit blackjack
3 stacks stay in my pocket
Ice-cold night warm anorak
Hands in hands, soft as lilac

Heart attack, heart attack
Hold me tight, my heart you hijacked
Cold blood, they call me a maniac
Your bitch a nymphomaniac
Heart attack, heart attack
Hold me tight, my heart you hijacked
Cold blood, they call me a maniac
Your bitch a nymphomaniac

Tired of being awake
I can't trust nobody else
No, no with this bloody heartache
Okay, time for a tea break
Fallen in love with you
That's my biggest mistake
Day by day
Thinking bout the past we had
Day by day
Slowly losing my inner self
Day by day
Feel like I'm living in hell
Run away
To somewhere that is far away
(Let the bone, soul vanished into thin air)
(Listen to the wind, wishes falling everywhere)
(Let the bone, soul vanished into thin air)
(Listen to the wind, wishes falling everywhere)
